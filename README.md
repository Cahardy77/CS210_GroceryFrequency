# CS210 Grocery Frequency Project
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In this project we were tasked with creating a program that would enable a 'company' to see how frequently items were bought in differing manners of output.

What did you do particularly well?
I think I created the code in a concise and standardized way. For example, I tried to keep open and closing files within their own functions and no where else if possible.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think a some of my code could be shortened and added to more functions to be called on. I also think there would be better utilization of classes if I had gone with that route.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I absolutely could not get c++ to integrate python. I know it has to do with the way I have been setting up the languages on systems, but I am not able to figure out what I am doing wrong. I overcame this issue by creating all code in c++ to handle the assignment requirments.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The knowlege of c++ of course, but also how different IDE's behave and how some have strengths over others. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made sure to use proper naming conventions that were understandable. I also made sure to use enough comments to allow another programmer to understand what was going on.
